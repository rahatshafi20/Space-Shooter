# Space-Shooter
This is my Object-Oriented Programming Course's project. I built this space shooter game using C++ and OOP concepts. SFML was used as the graphics library. All major functionalities of the game are completed, only a few visual effects and one or two add-ons were left due to time restraints.
Below is the link to a working video of this project.
